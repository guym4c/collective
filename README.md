#Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project allows people to share poems and messages with the world anonymously whilst contributing to an artistic project.

#What it does
COLLECTIVE; uses Twilio to parse texts, which are sent to a database. We use PHP to collect these entries from a webpage. The texts are then broken down into individual letters. Notes then play on the webpage corresponding to the letters. We use an iOS app to detect the pitch of the note, and reconstruct the message. Anyone can contribute; anyone can listen.

#How we built it
We used Twilio's API alongside PHP, HTML and CSS. We used Swift to develop the iOS application. We sourced the synth sounds online, and manipulated them using free audio editing software. We used Photoshop to create graphics.

#Challenges we ran into
We attempted numerous different approaches to this project. We wanted to use machine learning to identify soft synth noises but as all first years, this was out of our depth. We instead analysed frequency data to determine the pitch of a note, and had to substitute out our aesthetic synths for spooky piano noises.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works!

#What's next for COLLECTIVE;
Provided we had more time, we would have loved to have delved into machine learning and therefore allowing us to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
